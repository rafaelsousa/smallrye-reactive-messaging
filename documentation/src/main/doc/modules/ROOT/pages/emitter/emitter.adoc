= Sending / Receiving messages from non-reactive code

It is not rare to combine in a single application imperative parts (Jax-RS, regular CDI _beans_) and reactive parts (_beans_ with `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations).
In these case, it's often required to send _messages_ from the imperative part to the reactive part.
In other words, send messages to channels handled by reactive messaging and how can you retrieve messages.

== Emitter and @Channel

To send _things_ (payload or `Message`) from imperative code to a specific channel you need to use:

1. the {javadoc-base}/org/eclipse/microprofile/reactive/messaging/Channel.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel`] annotations
2. the {javadoc-base}/org/eclipse/microprofile/reactive/messaging/Emitter.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter`] type

The `@Channel` lets you indicate to which channel you are going to send your payloads or messages.
The `Emitter` is the object to use to send these payloads or messages.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/MyImperativeBean.java[tag=intro]
----

The `Emitter` class takes a type parameter. It's the type of payload.
Even if you want to send `Messages`, the type is the payload type.

IMPORTANT: You must have a `@Incoming("prices")` somewhere in your application (meaning a method consuming messages transiting on the channel `prices`), or an outbound connector configured to manage the `prices` channel (`mp.messaging.outgoing.prices...`)

[#emitter-payloads]
== Sending payloads

Sending payloads is done as follows:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=payload]
----

When sending a payload, the emitter returns a `CompletionStage`.
This `CompletionStage` gets completed once the message created from the payload is acknowledged:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=cs]
----

If the processing fails, the `CompletionStage` gets completed exceptionally (with the reason of the nack).

[#emitter-messages]
== Sending messages

You can also send `Messages`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=message]
----

When sending a `Message`, the emitter does not return a `CompletionStage`, but you can pass the ack/nack callback, and be called when the message is acked/nacked.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=message-ack]
----

Sending messages also let you pass metadata.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=message-meta]
----

Metadata can be used to propagate some context objects with the message.

[#emitter-overflow]
== Overflow management

When sending messages from imperative code to reactive code, you must be aware of back-pressure.
Indeed, messages sent using the emitter and stored in a _queue_.
If the consumer does not process the messages quickly enough, this queue can become a memory hog and you may even run out of memory.

To control what need to happen when the queue becomes out of control, use the {javadoc-base}/org/eclipse/microprofile/reactive/messaging/OnOverflow.Strategy.html[`org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.OnOverflow`] annotation.
`@OnOverflow` lets you configure:

* the maximum size of the queue (default is 256)
* what need to happen when this size is reached (fail, drop...)

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=overflow]
----

The supported strategies are:

* `OnOverflow.Strategy.BUFFER` - use a buffer to store the elements until they are consumed. If
the buffer is full, a failure is propagated (and the thread using the emitted gets an exception)
* `OnOverflow.Strategy.UNBOUNDED_BUFFER` - use an unbounded buffer to store the elements
* `OnOverflow.Strategy.DROP` - drops the most recent value if the downstream can't keep up. It means that new value
emitted by the emitter are ignored.
* `OnOverflow.Strategy.FAIL` - propagates a failure in case the downstream can't keep up.
* `OnOverflow.Strategy.LATEST` - keeps only the latest value, dropping any previous value if the downstream can't keep up.
* `OnOverflow.Strategy.NONE` - ignore the back-pressure signals letting the downstream consumer to implement a strategy.

[#streams]
== Retrieving channels

You can use the `@Channel` annotation to inject in your bean the underlying stream.
Note that in this case, you will be responsible for the subscription:


[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/ChannelExamples.java[tag=channel]
----

IMPORTANT: You must have a `@Outgoing("my-channel")` somewhere in your application (meaning a method generating messages transiting on the channel `my-channel`), or an inbound connector configured to manage the `prices` channel (`mp.messaging.incoming.prices...`)


Injected _channels_ merge all the matching _outgoing_ - so if you have multiple `@Outgoing("out")`, `@Inject @Channel("out")` gets all the messages.

If your injected _channel_ receives _payloads_ (`Multi<T>`), it acknowledges the message automatically, and support multiple subscribers.
If you injected _channel_ receives `Message` (`Multi<Message<T>>`), you will be responsible for the acknowledgement and broadcasting.

[#emitter-broadcast]
== Emitter and @Broadcast

When using an `Emitter`, you can now `@Broadcast` what is emitted to all subscribers.

Here is an example of emitting a price with two methods marked `@Incoming` to receive the broadcast:

include::example$emitter/EmitterExamples.java[tag=broadcast]
----

For more details see xref:advanced/broadcast.adoc[@Broadcast] documentation.

[#emitter-mutiny]
== Mutiny Emitter

If you prefer to utilize `Uni` in all your code,
there is now a `MutinyEmitter` that will return `Uni<Void>` instead of `void`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/MutinyExamples.java[tag=uni]
----

There's also the ability to block on sending the event to the emitter.
It will only return from the method when the event is acknowledged,
or nacked, by the receiver:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/MutinyExamples.java[tag=uni-await]
----

And if you don't need to worry about the success or failure of sending an event,
you can `sendAndForget`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$emitter/MutinyExamples.java[tag=uni-forget]
