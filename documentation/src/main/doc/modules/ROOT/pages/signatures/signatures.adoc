== Supported signatures

The following tables list the supported method signatures and indicate the various supported features.
For instance, they indicate the default and available acknowledgement strategies (when applicable).

IMPORTANT: When processing `Message`, it is often required to _chain_ the incoming `Message` to enable post-processing acknowledgement and metadata propagation.
Use the `with` (like `withPayload`) methods from the incoming message, so it copies the metadata and ack/nack methods.
It returns a new `Message` with the right content.
