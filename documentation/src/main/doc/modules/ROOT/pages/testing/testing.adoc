= Testing without brokers

IMPORTANT: Due to a more strict channel name validation introduced in 2.x, the API has changed in 2.1.0.

It's not rare to have to test your application but deploying the infrastructure can be cumbersome.
While Docker or Test Containers have improved the testing experience, you may want to _mock_ this infrastructure.

SmallRye Reactive Messaging proposes an _in-memory_ connector for this exact purpose.
It allows switching the connector used for a channel with an _in-memory_ connector.
This in-memory connector provides a way to send messages to incoming channels, or check the received messages for outgoing
channels.

To use the _in-memory_ connector, you need to add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-in-memory</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Then, in a test, you can do something like:

[source,java]
----
include::example$testing/MyTest.java[]
----

When switching a channel to the in-memory connector, all the configuration properties are ignored.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This connector has been designed for testing purpose only.
====

The _switch_ methods return `Map<String, String>` instances containing the set properties.
While these system properties are already set, you can retrieve them and pass them around, for example if you need to start an external process with these properties:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$testing/MyTestSetup.java[tags=code]
----

NOTE: The in-memory connector support the `broadcast` and `merge` attributes.
So, if your connector is configured with `broadcast: true`, the connector broadcasts the messages to all the channel consumers.
If your connector is configured with `merge:true`, the connector receives all the messages sent to the mapped channel even when coming from multiple producers.
