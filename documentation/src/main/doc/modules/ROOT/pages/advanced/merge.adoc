== Merge

[IMPORTANT]
.Experimental
====
`@Merge` is an experimental feature.

By default, messages transiting in a channel can arise from a single producer.
Having multiple producers is considered erroneous and is reported at deployment time.

The {javadoc-base}/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/annotations/Merge.html[`Merge`] annotation changes this behavior and indicates that a channel can have multiple producers.
`@Merge` must be used with the `@Incoming` annotation:

In the previous example, the consumer gets all the messages (from both producers).

The `@Merge` annotation allows configuring how the incoming messages (from the different producers) are merged into the channel.
The `mode` attribute allows configuring this behavior:

* `ONE` picks a single producer, discarding the other producer;
* `MERGE` (default) gets all the messages as they come, without any defined order. Messages from different producers may be interleaved.
* `CONCAT` concatenates the producers. The messages from one producer are received until the messages from other producers are received.

NOTE: Outbound connectors also support a `merge` attribute that allows consuming the messages to multiple upstreams. It will dispatch all the received messages.
